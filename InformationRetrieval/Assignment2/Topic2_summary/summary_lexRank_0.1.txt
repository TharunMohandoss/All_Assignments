    ``I think there's a lot of it going on because of the pressures in women's sports, and not just to win.
    ``Tennis is a sport I would not have thought would be steroid-involved, but there's tons of steroids out there these days, and they're not all coming from the black market,'' said Dr. Alan Jones, a pharmaceutics professor at the University of Mississippi who acts as the toxicology consultant for the company that administers drug testing for the men's ATP and women's WTA tours and for the ITF.
    According to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, up to 13 percent of all high school athletes use anabolic steroids and 40 percent of those athletes believe the illegal drug is not harmful.
    ``Some athletes have been using creatine and andro as a smokescreen for their use of other more potent supplements,'' he said.
``You can look at the tests, and you may know the athlete is on steroids, but there's nothing you can do about it.''
``The technology may be at that level to test the athletes at the 2000 Olympics in Sydney.
    ``People are now convinced there is a test, that the IOC is prepared to apply it and nobody wants to send athletes to the Games that are going to get caught and disgraced,'' said Dick Pound, an IOC vice president from Montreal who is head of the World Anti-Doping Agency, created by the IOC in the wake of the EPO scandal at the 1998 Tour de France.
