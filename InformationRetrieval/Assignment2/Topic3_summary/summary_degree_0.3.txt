The symposium, which is held in Beidaihe, a sea-side resort in north China's Hebei Province, is jointly sponsored by the Chinese Ministry of Forestry, the Japan's Environmental Agency and the Asia-Pacific Branch of the Wetlands International.

NEW YORK _ The federal government announced Thursday tougher restrictions for building on wetlands within the New York City watershed.
Last year, the Corps ordered 47,000 acres of new wetlands, which is more than the 31,000 acres they allowed to be damaged.
China now has 63 million hectares of various kinds of wetlands, or 6.6 percent of the national total area and ranking first in Asia, among which some have been listed as "Wetlands of International Importance."
This will require careful scrutiny of thousands of individual development proposals that the Corps could ignore under the old rules.
The EPA has only 26 people nationwide in its technical wetland enforcement division, including one full-time employee based in Boston.
According to sources who have seen the new regulations, the Corps will require developers to obtain specific permits for projects affecting at least a half-acre of wetlands, compared to three acres under current regulations.
The Corps first began reviewing the wetlands rules in 1995 and 1996.
