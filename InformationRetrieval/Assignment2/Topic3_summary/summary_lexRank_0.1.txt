Last year, the Corps ordered 47,000 acres of new wetlands, which is more than the 31,000 acres they allowed to be damaged.
    The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers scheduled a news conference for Monday to announce the new rules, which have been debated internally for more than four years and were spurred by an environmental group's lawsuit.
The rules would require developers to secure a permit from the Corps for all projects affecting a half-acre of wetlands or more, down from the current minimum of three acres.
    The rules, issued by the Environmental Protection Agency and the Army Corps of Engineers, are part of the administration's effort to fight the court decision, issued in January 1997 by a federal district judge in Washington and upheld in June 1998 by the District of Columbia U.S.
    Wetlands in the Pinelands and throughout the state are supposed to be off limits to development because of their value as a wildlife habitat and a water cleansing system.
The resort could be looking at civil fines of up to  $27,500 a day if the EPA determines the road is a violation of the  Clean Water Act, which requires permits for construction through  wetlands to protect migratory birds and other fauna.
At the Corps, Clinton has repeatedly asked for $11 million more for regulation of wetlands than the $106 million approved by Congress this year, a reflection of conservatives' belief that the Corps is often an obstacle to development.
