And it's going to have to be the Shinnecock.''
Of the 22 tribes across New Mexico, 11 now operate casinos, and it is estimated that they take in more than $350 million a year in gambling revenues.
    With the desperately needed jobs and money that casinos have brought to reservations, few people in the tribes have been publicly critical of casino gambling on their reservations.
    The Shinnecock are a state-recognized tribe, but one of more than 100 Indian tribes not acknowledged by the federal government.
    Members of the tribe have a right to live on the reservation, but many survive on low-wage jobs and welfare _ the consequence of a people ``living in abject poverty'' for 200 years, according to Robert Coulter, a lawyer with the Indian Law Resource Center, a nonprofit group that is helping the Onondagas on their proposed claim.
It takes in just $900,000 or so a year and employs only 23 people, but tribal leaders say it is an economic godsend for a reservation with 74 percent unemployment.
The unemployment rate on that reservation, however, still was 45 percent in 1997, and the average poverty rate in the two counties it touches rose from 10.4 percent in 1989 to 12.1 percent in 1995.
An estimated 50  percent of American Indians are unemployed, and at Pine Ridge the  problem is even more chronic -- 73 percent of the people do not have  jobs.
