Vioxx has an indication for treatment of acute pain; Celebrex does not _ it has been approved for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis and osteoarthritis.

But Celebrex and Vioxx cost from $90 to $120 a month, which can be prohibitive for many people, especially if they have little or no prescription drug coverage.

    A different drug of the same type, Merck &AMP; Co.'s Vioxx, is awaiting approval by the Food and Drug Administration and could be on the market by summer.
